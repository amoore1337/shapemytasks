# Shape My Tasks

Monorepo for shapemytasks.com.

Simple web application for tracking tasks on a [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup)-inspired hill chart.

## Development

1. Run

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

2. Navigate to `client` directory and install dependencies

```bash
$ cd ./client && npm install
```

3. Start `client` dev server

```bash
$ npm start
```

4. In a separate terminal shell, go to `server` and install dependencies

```bash
$ ./server && npm install
```

5. Start `server` dev server

```bash
$ npm start
```

6. For first time setup, you will need to run migrations against local db

```bash
$ npm run db:push
```

7. Go to https://localhost/ in your browser

## Production Simulation

1. Run

```bash
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod-sim.yml up -d --build
```

2. Go to https://localhost/ in your browser

## Useful Commands

- Connect to db:

```bash
$ docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres smt
```

- Backup db:

```bash
$ sudo docker-compose exec db sh -c "pg_dump -U username smt" > ~/Desktop/backup.sql
```

## Notes

- TODO: Container networking hasn't been tested for MacOS development, might need some tweaks.
- On Windows, if localhost can't be reached, run `wsl --shutdown` which will also restart docker. See [this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4204).
- Blocked dependency updates:
  - `history`: Can update once `react-router-dom` supports v5 ([issue](https://github.com/ReactTraining/history/issues/804))
